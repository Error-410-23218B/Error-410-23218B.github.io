      <h2>GNU Cross Compiler</h2>

      <p class="search-text">If you're diving into OS development, one of the first steps is building a cross-compiler—a tool that lets you
        compile code for an environment different from your own. For OS newbies, setting up a GCC cross-compiler
        targeting
        i686-elf is key. This configuration provides a 32-bit setup, perfect for booting with GRUB, a widely-used
        bootloader, and avoiding headaches with Linux-specific binaries that aren’t compatible with custom OS needs.</p>

      <h2 class="search-text">Code Structure</h2>

      <p class="search-text">
        Once the cross-compiler is set up, your minimal OS needs just three files:
      </p>

      <ul style="text-align: left; list-style-type: disc;">
        <li class="search-text">boot.s, which contains essential assembly code to initialize the processor</li>
        <li class="search-text">kernel.c for the main OS routines</li>
        <li class="search-text">linker.ld to link it all together</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="search-text">GNU Grub</h2>

      <p class="search-text">GRUB will search for a specific Multiboot header in boot.s to load the OS, ensuring that everything is set up
        properly for the kernel to take over.</p>

      <p class="search-text">For a starter OS, a simple text output via the VGA buffer is a great way to start. Just remember: newer
        machines might not support this text mode, so it’s worth learning about framebuffer graphics if you want
        future-proof compatibility. Writing your kernel in C++? Go for it—just keep in mind some features are limited,
        like exceptions and memory allocation.</p>

      <p class="search-text">
        Testing your OS is easy, too, thanks to QEMU, a virtual machine that speeds up development by letting you see
        changes live, no constant rebooting required. With these basics in place, you’re ready to get your "Hello World"
        OS running!
      </p>

      <h2 class="search-text">Sysroot</h2>

      <p class="search-text">
        When building a custom operating system (OS), system roots or "sysroots" allow for a contained directory
        structure resembling the root of your OS. This directory structure stores components like headers and libraries
        in locations that mimic traditional system directories (/usr/include, /usr/lib). The sysroot acts as a sandbox,
        holding OS-specific development files and facilitating the build process. In this setup, kernel headers are
        stored separately for modularity, and the GNU GRUB bootloader and Multiboot standard are used for kernel
        booting.</p>

      <h2 class="search-text">LibC/LibK</h2>
      <p class="search-text">
        To ensure compatibility, the libc (standard library) is split into two versions: a standalone version (libk)
        that excludes user-space code, and a basic libc.a for future user-space. Each library function is modularly
        placed in separate files, and custom macros like __is_kernel, __is_libc, and __is_libk help code discern its
        environment. The configuration and build scripts also employ flags to prevent standard library searches and
        allow custom paths.
      </p>

      <h2 class="search-text">Interrupts</h2>

      <p class="search-text">
        In computing, interrupts are essential mechanisms that allow devices to send signals to the CPU to temporarily
        pause its current task and execute specific code to address the interrupting device's request. For instance, a
        keyboard might signal an interrupt when a key is pressed, prompting the CPU to display the character on-screen
        immediately, then return to its previous task.
      </p>

      <h2 class="search-text">Types of Interrupts</h2>
      <p class="search-text">
        Interrupts generally fall into three main categories:
      </p>

      <ul style="text-align: left; list-style-type: disc;">
        <li class="search-text">Exceptions: These are internally generated by the CPU to alert the operating system (OS) of events like
          faults or errors that require attention, such as page faults or division errors.</li>
        <li class="search-text">Hardware Interrupts (IRQs): These originate from external devices, like a keyboard or hard drive, and signal
          the CPU via dedicated interrupt lines or messages. They’re managed by an Interrupt</li>
        <li class="search-text">Request Controller (IRQ Controller), like the Intel 8259, which serializes and prioritizes interrupts before
          sending them to the CPU. IRQs can be communicated through:</li>
        <li class="search-text">Pin-based IRQs: Using physical connections (lines) to transmit interrupts.</li>
        <li class="search-text">Message Signaled Interrupts (MSIs): Sending data to a specific memory location, triggering an interrupt,
          commonly used in PCI buses.</li>
        <li class="search-text">Software Interrupts: Initiated by software, these interrupts prompt the OS to perform actions like system
          calls. On x86 systems, the "INT" instruction triggers software interrupts, often using a specific vector, such
          as 0x80, to signal the kernel.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="search-text">
        The Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT)

      </h2>

      <p class="search-text">The IDT is a lookup table used by the CPU to find the appropriate interrupt service routine (ISR) for a given
        interrupt. In x86 systems, this table can contain up to 256 entries, with the first 32 vectors often reserved
        for exceptions. The IDT allows the CPU to seamlessly jump to the correct ISR to handle each interrupt type.</p>

      <h2 class="search-text">
        How the Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC) Works

      </h2>

      <p class="search-text">The PIC organizes and prioritizes hardware interrupts. In most systems, two PICs handle up to 16 different
        IRQs, with one serving as the master PIC and the other as a slave PIC. When a device requests an interrupt, it’s
        sent to the slave PIC, which signals the master PIC, which, in turn, notifies the CPU.</p>


      <p class="search-text">By default, certain IRQs (like IRQ 0-7) are assigned specific interrupt vectors (08h-0Fh), and higher IRQs
        (8-15) map to vectors 70h-77h. However, to avoid conflicts with reserved CPU interrupts, the PIC can be
        reprogrammed to use different vectors for these IRQs.</p>

      <h2 class="search-text">Handling Interrupts in the OS </h2>

      <p class="search-text">When an interrupt is detected, the OS, through its preconfigured IDT, initiates an interrupt handler (or ISR).
        This handler communicates with the interrupting device, performs the necessary tasks (like processing a key
        press), and then signals the PIC that it’s ready to handle additional interrupts. Finally, the CPU returns to
        its previous state using the iret instruction, which restores the saved state information from the stack.</p>

      <h2 class="search-text">Controlling Interrupts with the CPU’s Interrupt Flag
      </h2>

      <p class="search-text">The CPU’s Interrupt Flag (IF) in the status register determines whether it should respond to interrupts. By
        clearing this flag (using the cli instruction), the CPU will ignore interrupts, allowing critical operations to
        proceed uninterrupted. When ready, the IF can be set again using sti, re-enabling the response to incoming
        interrupts.</p>

      <h2 class="search-text">Global Descriptor Table</h2>

      <p class="search-text">The Global Descriptor Table (GDT) is a critical component in x86 architecture that the CPU uses to manage
        memory access and establish a secure environment in protected mode. The GDT holds descriptors, which define the
        properties of memory segments like base address, size, and access rights. These descriptors control how code,
        data, and system segments are accessed, helping the CPU enforce privilege levels and maintain stability.</p>

      <h2 class="search-text">Purpose of the GDT</h2>

      <p class="search-text">The GDT is used primarily for two functions:</p>

      <ul style="text-align: left; list-style-type: disc;">
        <li class="search-text">Memory Segmentation: By defining segments, it allows the CPU to access specific areas of memory based on
          rules set in each segment’s descriptor. Segmentation provides isolation and protects critical sections of
          memory.</li>

        <li class="search-text">Privilege Levels: The GDT enables access control to memory regions based on privilege levels, allowing
          certain code or data to be accessible only to specific processes, such as the kernel or applications.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="search-text">Structure of the GDT </h2>

      <p class="search-text">The GDT is a table in memory that contains entries called descriptors. Each descriptor holds information for a
        segment, which includes: </p>

      <ul style="text-align: left; list-style-type: disc;">
        <li class="search-text">Base Address: The starting address of the memory segment.</li>
        <li class="search-text">Segment Limit: The size or boundary of the segment.</li>
        <li class="search-text">Access Byte: This byte indicates the segment type, privilege level, and whether it’s executable, readable,
          writable, etc.</li>
        <li class="search-text">Flags: These bits specify the segment type and size, such as whether the segment is 32-bit or 64-bit.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="search-text">Types of Segments in the GDT</h2>

      <p class="search-text">The GDT can define different segment types for different purposes:</p>

      <ul style="text-align: left; list-style-type: disc;">
        <li class="search-text">Code Segment: Stores the code that the CPU executes. Typically marked as executable and readable.</li>
        <li class="search-text">Data Segment: Stores data used by programs. This segment can be readable, writable, but not executable.</li>
        <li class="search-text">Stack Segment: Used for the stack, where function call return addresses and local variables are stored.</li>
        <li class="search-text">System Segments: Include the Task State Segment (TSS) and Local Descriptor Table (LDT). The TSS is crucial
          in multitasking, as it holds information about task states, while the LDT offers additional segmentation for a
          particular process.</li>

      </ul>

<h2 class="search-text">How the CPU Uses the GDT</h2>

<ul style="text-align: left; list-style-type: disc;">
  <li class="search-text">Protected Mode: When the CPU is in protected mode, it uses the GDT to manage memory access by using selectors, which are pointers to specific entries in the GDT.</li>
  <li class="search-text">Segmentation in Execution: Each memory access (code execution, data fetch, etc.) involves a segment selector, which points to a specific descriptor in the GDT. The CPU reads the descriptor to interpret the properties of that memory segment.</li>
  <li class="search-text">Privilege Levels: The GDT allows up to four privilege levels (0-3). The OS kernel typically runs at level 0, while user applications operate at level 3. This isolation protects critical OS code and data from being accessed by less privileged software.</li>

</ul>

<h2 class="search-text">Loading the GDT</h2>

<p class="search-text">To use the GDT, the CPU needs to know its address, which is loaded using the lgdt instruction with a special structure called the GDTR (Global Descriptor Table Register). The GDTR stores the base address and limit of the GDT, letting the CPU locate the GDT quickly.</p>

<h2 class="search-text">Practical Uses in an OS</h2>

<p class="v">Operating systems set up a GDT at boot and configure segments for kernel and user space. They use the GDT for:</p>

<ul style="text-align: left; list-style-type: disc;">
  <li class="search-text">Memory Protection: Prevents user-space applications from accessing kernel memory.
  </li>
  <li class="search-text">Task Switching: Uses the TSS descriptor in the GDT for saving and restoring task states during context switches.
  </li>

  <li class="search-text">Multitasking and Privilege Separation: Ensures that only privileged code can execute critical tasks, safeguarding the system from potential vulnerabilities in user applications.
  </li>

</ul>
