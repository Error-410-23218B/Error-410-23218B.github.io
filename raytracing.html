      <p>This post provides a detailed, step-by-step guide for building a GPU-based ray tracing engine using NVIDIA's
        CUDA platform. It emphasizes the performance benefits of GPU computation, as CUDA enables faster processing of
        image rendering tasks, especially when compared to traditional CPU-based approaches. Here’s a breakdown of the
        key concepts and processes outlined for setting up this system.</p>

      <h2>Introduction to Ray Tracing</h2>
      <p>Ray tracing simulates the way light interacts with objects in a virtual environment to produce realistic
        images. With NVIDIA’s Turing GPUs, RTX technology, and DirectX Ray Tracing, ray tracing has become more
        accessible and powerful. However, for those who wish to understand the workings behind it, coding a ray tracing
        engine provides insight into its mathematical and computational principles.</p>

      <h2>Learning Resources </h2>

      <p>Peter Shirley’s "Ray Tracing in One Weekend" series is a beginner-friendly set of resources available for free.
        Shirley’s books cover the fundamentals of ray tracing in a progression from basic concepts to more complex ones,
        making it an ideal foundation for implementing ray tracing on GPUs. The original C++ code provided in the books
        can be transformed into CUDA-compatible code, leveraging GPU power to speed up the rendering</p>

      <p style="text-align: left;">
        The CUDA version of the ray tracer translates Shirley’s C++ implementation into GPU-friendly code, gaining up to
        a 10x performance boost:
      </p>

      <ul style="text-align: left; list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>File Naming: Change the primary C++ file’s extension from .cc to .cu to indicate CUDA code.</li>
        <li>Error Handling: Implement a checkCudaErrors macro to manage CUDA’s error codes, which ensures smooth
          debugging and device resetting.</li>
        <li>Memory Allocation: Allocate frame buffer memory using cudaMallocManaged, allowing Unified Memory access for
          seamless data transfer between CPU and GPU.</li>
        <li>Kernel Launch: The rendering kernel (render) is launched on blocks of threads (e.g., 8x8 blocks) to
          parallelize the work of coloring each pixel.</li>

      </ul>

      <h2>Implementing Core Functions in CUDA</h2>

      <p style="text-align: left;">The CUDA engine begins by constructing a gradient image,
        progressively advancing through these steps:</p>

      <ul style="text-align: left; list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>File Naming: Change the primary C++ file’s extension from .cc to .cu to indicate CUDA code.</li>
        <li>Color Calculation: The render kernel computes pixel colors by mapping coordinates to color values (RGB).
        </li>

        <li>Vector Operations: Define vector classes with __host__ __device__ annotations to support CPU and GPU
          compatibility. This approach allows for optimized vector manipulation, necessary for 3D rendering.</li>
        <li>Ray Class: Introduce the ray class with __device__ annotations to create rays within the kernel.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Optimizing Performance</h2>

      <p>CUDA’s performance hinges on using single precision floats, as double precision can be much slower. CUDA
        profiling tools like nvprof help identify any accidental double-precision calculations. Profiling helps ensure
        that the code remains efficient on GPUs, particularly when using random number generation with cuRAND.</p>

      <h2>Memory Management</h2>

      <p style="text-align: left;"> Memory management on the GPU is crucial. Each class that interacts
        with the GPU (such as hitable and sphere) must be allocated and freed correctly:</p>

      <ul style="text-align: left; list-style-type: disc;">

        <li>Allocate lists of hitable objects on the GPU.</li>
        <li>Define a create_world kernel to initialize objects in the scene.</li>
        <li>Clean up memory with the free_world kernel to delete objects after rendering.</li>

      </ul>

      <h2> Handling Randomness</h2>
      <p>Ray tracing often incorporates randomness for effects like shadows and reflections. CUDA’s cuRAND library is
        used to initialize random states for each thread. This setup ensures that each thread can generate its own
        random numbers, allowing for realistic rendering without excessive CPU-GPU synchronization overhead.</p>

      <h2>Summary</h2>

      <p>The steps in this guide lay the groundwork for a powerful GPU-based ray tracing engine that leverages CUDA’s
        parallel processing capabilities. The approach begins with a fundamental understanding of ray tracing and
        progresses into memory management, randomness, and profiling for optimal performance on NVIDIA hardware. For
        developers interested in understanding and working with graphics programming, implementing a CUDA-based ray
        tracer provides practical experience in both ray tracing theory and GPU programming.</p>
