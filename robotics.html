      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>VEX Robotics is a leading provider of educational robotics solutions designed to engage students in STEM
        (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) learning through hands-on experience. The platform includes
        hardware, software, competitions, and curriculum resources, making it a comprehensive tool for educators and
        students alike. My contribution to the 23218B Team as Chief Programmer has been pivotal to its success</p>

      <h2>Odometry </h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Odometry is a methodology that can find the robot‚Äôs position at any place on the field</li>
        <li>By using three tracking wheels on the drivetrain, we will calculate the robot‚Äôs X,Y, and angle value based
          on an origin point on the field.</li>

        <li>Equations:
          <ul>
            <li> ùö´s sin(ùõ≥+ùö´ùõ≥/2)=ùö´y</li>
            <li> ùö´s cos(ùõ≥+ùö´ùõ≥/2)=ùö´x</li>
            <li> ùö´sr -ùö´sl = ùö´ùõ≥2L</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          We will use Odometry in autonomous to calculate where the robot is at any point in time
        </li>
      </ul>


      <h2>Odometry Code Explanation</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Each encoder is stored in a class object, which allows us to reuse the single algorithmic method for
          multiple encoders. Variables are stored in class variables, allowing us to store it for use later on.</li>
        <li>The local offset when no distance has been travelled is found by setting the local offset X value to amount
          turned by the back encoder local offset Y value to amount turned by the right encoder. Else, when distance has
          been travelled use the equation:
        </li>

        <li>New average orientation is calculated by finding the negative of the current average orientation - previous
          absolute orientation + (change in absolute orientation/2)
        </li>
        <li> Convert (x,y) coordinates into (r,Œ∏).(r means radius, Œ∏ mean angle) translate coordinates, reconvert vice
          versa back to (x,y) coordinates.</li>
        <li>Add together previous global offset and current global offset, then update prevGlobalOffset and return
          absolute position from the method
        </li>
        <li>Jumper function to allow tracking method to be ran in a task, allowing for parallel programming.</li>

      </ul>

      <h2>PID</h2>
      <ul>
        <h3>P-Proportional</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Proportional decelerates the drive as it approaches the target </li>
          <li>By calculating the error(distance from the target), we will multiply this by a gain factor so the closer
            the robot gets to its target, the smaller error will be</li>
          <li>We will use this to decelerate the robot in drive commands</li>
          <li>Equation : K<sub>p</sub> e(t) </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>I- Integral</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Integral accelerates the drive when proportional undershoots.</li>
          <li>Multiplies a gain factor by the total accumulation of errors over time</li>
          <li>We will use this to accelerate the robot as it approaches the target to insure the robot reaches its
            destination </li>
          <li>Equation : K<sub>i</sub> e(t) </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>D- Derivative</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Derivative restricts rapid changes in motion for both acceleration and deceleration</li>
          <li>Multiplies a gain factor by the change in distance from the target over the change of time </li>
          <li>We will use this in our autonomous programs to prevent the robot from making sloppy movements that cause
            dri~ from the intended route </li>
          <li>Equation: K<sub>d</sub> <sup>de(t)</sup>&frasl;<sub>dt</sub></li>
        </ul>

      </ul>

      <h2>Custom Drivetrain</h2>

      <p>The custom drivetrain uses the PID Controller class to control the limits and control the velocity and distance
        moved and degrees turned for the robot. Using a custom drivetrain instead of using the inbuilt vex drivetrain
        eliminates the inaccuracies in the vex drivetrain, which makes the robot‚Äôs autonomous more accurate and work
        more efficiently and it also means the driver control for the drivetrain is smoother and more intuitive to use.
      </p>

      <p>The code is structured in an object oriented model, where the custom drivetrain inherits from the PID
        controller class, which is used for motion calculations, where there are various ‚Äúsetter‚Äù and ‚Äúgetter‚Äù methods
        to abstract the underlying class logic and function for the drivetrain making it easier to use in the rest of
        the program. The slewer algorithm also uses the time taken for the algorithm to set the max increase for the
        slewer.</p>

      <p>The custom drivetrain also implements a ‚Äúslewer‚Äù algorithm which allows the drivetrain motors to synchronise
        together and to spin up to speed by quadratically interpolating the speed(‚Äúhalf and half again increments‚Äù).
        This ensures motors which are not mechanically linked spin at the same speed which ensures accurate motion
        control.</p>

      <p>The custom drivetrain also implements odometry as the main use of the algorithm as it uses the absolute
        position, and using the aforementioned algorithms to drive towards the position on the field, where the
        orientation is changed using the turning algorithm, it changes using the PID algorithms for control and it spins
        the motor based on the amount of rotations required to turn the robot a certain amount.
      </p>

      <h2>RAMSETE Controller</h2>

      <p>The RAMSETE controller unlike other controllers is designed to actively profile and control the 2D motion of
        the robot, with the RAMSETE controller building on top of odometry it allows for the robot to accurately follow
        a desired trajectory while it prevents the robot from overshooting or straying from a set trajectory which makes
        it an accurate controller, where it represents the trajectory of the robot as a series of waypoints on the field
        and plotted against time.
      </p>

      <p>It takes into account the actuators on a robot and how that affects the trajectory of the robot, it also unlike
        other controllers, which only control the robot‚Äôs local frame (e.g change in velocity or change in distance).
      </p>

      <p>The RAMSETE controller via odometry is able to account for the robot‚Äôs global position and heading, which makes
        it a more viable controller for an accurate autonomous.
      </p>

      <p>The RAMSETE controller also takes into account the various aspects of the robot such as the mass of the robot,
        its inertia and the characteristics of the actuators, e.g their velocities and how that affects how the robot
        moves, e.g Drivetrain velocity,
